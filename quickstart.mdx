## Get Started

To start using the AI Wardrobe API, you'll need to make a POST request to one of our endpoints. 

### Virtual Try-On

To perform a virtual try-on, you can send a request to the `/api/v1/generate` endpoint. You can provide images as URLs or as base64 encoded strings.

Check out the [Virtual Try-On](/api-reference/endpoint/virtual-try-on) endpoint documentation for more details.

### Pose Validation

To validate the pose in an image, you can send a request to the `/api/v1/analyzers/validate-pose/` endpoint.

Check out the [Pose Validation](/api-reference/endpoint/pose-validation) endpoint documentation for more details.
